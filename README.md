## GOTAK

More of a "Baby's First Golang" project, really, than anything serious. An attempt to write an implementation of [Tak](http://cheapass.com/tak/), a game designed by James Garfield and Patrick Rothfuss.

Rules can [be found here](http://cheapass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TakShortRules.pdf)

### TODO

- Someday: maybe an actual Parser for *Portable Tak Notation* (PTN) https://www.reddit.com/r/Tak/wiki/portable_tak_notation
